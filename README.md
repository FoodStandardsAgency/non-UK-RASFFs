# non-UK RASFFs

## Background
The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) system is made up of alerts about food and feed risks. Knowledge of how non-UK RASFFs (*i.e.* those that ar not raised by the UK, or do not list it as a country a given product is distributed to) relate to coming UK RASFFs is valuable to colleagues processing alerts.

This project collaborated with experts who use the RASFF system as part of their work. From their input about relevant factors, and how these may interrelate, a Bayesian network was constructed. Conditional probability tables were created using historic RASFF data.
